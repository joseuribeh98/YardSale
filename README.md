# PlatziJS_Practical_Course_Project

## Description
This is a simple yet interactive JavaScript project created as part of the Practical JavaScript Course on Platzi. The main aim of this project is to demonstrate the foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Basic Web Layout**: The project provides a simple, effective user interface for a shop designed using HTML and CSS. It includes key layout elements such as a navigation bar, main content area with a list of products using CSS grid and rendered using a fake API.

- **JavaScript Functionality**: Product cards and product details have been added to the main view using JavaScript. These demonstrate basic JavaScript functionalities like event handling, DOM manipulation, and data manipulation.

- **Code Structure and Readability**: The project's codebase is well-structured and readable, in line with best practices taught during the course. This makes it a great learning resource for beginners.
